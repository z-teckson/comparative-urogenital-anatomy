# Introduction and Gross Anatomy of the Human Penis

## Introduction to Comparative Urogenital Anatomy

Comparative urogenital anatomy examines the structural and functional variations of the urinary and reproductive systems across different species. This field provides critical insights into evolutionary adaptations, clinical correlations, and fundamental principles of organ development. For medical students, a thorough understanding of human urogenital anatomy is essential for diagnosing and treating disorders, while knowledge of comparative anatomy enriches this perspective by highlighting unique mammalian features (e.g., the presence or absence of a baculum).

This study guide begins with the gross anatomy of the human penis, a complex organ involved in both urinary excretion and sexual reproduction.

## Gross Anatomy of the Human Penis

### External Features
The penis is divided into three main regions:
1. **Root (radix)**: The attached portion, consisting of the *bulb of the penis* (formed by the expanded corpus spongiosum) and the *crura* (two posterior extensions of the corpora cavernosa). The root is anchored to the perineum and pubic arch.
2. **Body (shaft)**: The free, pendulous portion that extends from the root to the glans. It is composed of three cylindrical bodies of erectile tissue enclosed by fascial layers.
3. **Glans**: The expanded, conical distal end of the corpus spongiosum. It is covered by the prepuce (foreskin) in uncircumcised individuals and contains the external urethral orifice.

### Internal Structure
The shaft contains three erectile bodies:
- **Corpora cavernosa** (two): Paired dorsal cylinders that are the principal erectile tissues. They are surrounded by the tough *tunica albuginea* and separated by an incomplete septum.
- **Corpus spongiosum** (one): A ventral cylinder that houses the urethra. It expands distally to form the glans and proximally to form the bulb.

### Fascial Coverings
From deep to superficial:
- **Buck's fascia** (deep fascia of penis): A strong fibrous layer that surrounds all three erectile bodies, binding them together.
- **Superficial (dartos) fascia**: A loose connective‑tissue layer continuous with the superficial perineal (Colles’) fascia and the abdominal Scarpa’s fascia.
- **Skin**: Thin, hairless, and highly elastic.

### Vascular Supply
- **Arteries**: Primarily from the internal pudendal artery, giving rise to the *deep artery of the penis* (supplies corpora cavernosa), the *dorsal artery of the penis* (runs along the dorsum), and the *artery of the bulb* (supplies corpus spongiosum and bulb).
- **Veins**: Drain into the deep dorsal vein (empties into the prostatic venous plexus) and the superficial dorsal vein (drains to the external pudendal veins).

### Innervation
- **Somatic**: Pudendal nerve (S2–S4) supplies motor fibers to the bulbospongiosus and ischiocavernosus muscles and sensory fibers to the penile skin and glans.
- **Autonomic**: Pelvic splanchnic nerves (parasympathetic, S2–S4) mediate erection; sympathetic fibers (T10–L2) are involved in ejaculation.

### Lymphatic Drainage
Lymph from the skin and glans drains to the superficial inguinal nodes; lymph from the erectile tissues and urethra drains to the deep inguinal and internal iliac nodes.

### Comparative Note
Unlike many other mammals (e.g., rodents, carnivores), the human penis lacks an os penis (baculum). This bony element is absent in humans, primates, and some other groups, reflecting differences in copulatory mechanics and sexual selection.
