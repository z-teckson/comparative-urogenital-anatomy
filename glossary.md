# Key Terms and Definitions

## A
**Andrology**  
The medical specialty concerned with male health, particularly the male reproductive system and urogenital disorders.

**Artery of the bulb**  
A branch of the internal pudendal artery that supplies the bulb of the penis and the corpus spongiosum.

## B
**Baculum (os penis)**  
A bone found within the penis of many mammals (e.g., rodents, carnivores, some primates) that provides structural support during copulation. Absent in humans.

**Buck's fascia**  
The deep fascia of the penis, a strong fibrous layer that surrounds the three erectile bodies and binds them together.

## C
**Corpora cavernosa**  
Paired cylindrical erectile tissues located dorsally in the penile shaft. They are the principal structures responsible for penile rigidity during erection.

**Corpus spongiosum**  
A single ventral erectile cylinder that surrounds the urethra. It expands distally to form the glans and proximally to form the bulb of the penis.

## D
**Deep artery of the penis**  
A terminal branch of the internal pudendal artery that runs within the corpora cavernosa and supplies the cavernous sinuses via helicine arteries.

**Detumescence**  
The process by which the penis returns to its flaccid state after erection, involving smooth‑muscle contraction, reduced arterial inflow, and restored venous drainage.

## E
**Erectile dysfunction**  
The consistent inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. Often multifactorial (vascular, neurological, hormonal, psychological).

**Erection**  
A neurovascular phenomenon characterized by increased arterial inflow, sinusoidal expansion, and veno‑occlusion, resulting in penile rigidity.

## G
**Glans penis**  
The conical, expanded distal end of the corpus spongiosum. It is covered by the prepuce (foreskin) in uncircumcised individuals and contains the external urethral orifice.

## H
**Helicine arteries**  
Coiled branches of the deep artery of the penis that open directly into the cavernous sinuses. Their relaxation is essential for initiating erection.

## I
**Internal pudendal artery**  
The primary artery supplying the perineum and external genitalia. It gives rise to the deep, dorsal, and bulbourethral arteries of the penis.

## N
**Nitric oxide (NO)**  
A gaseous signaling molecule released by nitrergic nerve endings and vascular endothelium in the penis. It activates soluble guanylate cyclase, leading to smooth‑muscle relaxation and erection.

## P
**Peyronie’s disease**  
A connective‑tissue disorder characterized by fibrotic plaque formation in the tunica albuginea, causing penile curvature, pain, and sometimes erectile dysfunction.

**Phosphodiesterase‑5 (PDE5)**  
The enzyme that degrades cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in penile smooth muscle. Inhibition by drugs such as sildenafil (Viagra®) prolongs erection.

**Priapism**  
A prolonged, often painful erection that persists beyond or is unrelated to sexual stimulation. Classified as ischemic (low‑flow) or non‑ischemic (high‑flow).

## S
**Spongy urethra**  
The portion of the male urethra that traverses the corpus spongiosum. It is lined by stratified or pseudostratified columnar epithelium proximally and stratified squamous epithelium distally.

## T
**Tunica albuginea**  
The dense, fibrous sheath that surrounds each corpus cavernosum (bilayered) and the corpus spongiosum (thinner and more elastic). Provides structural integrity and participates in the veno‑occlusive mechanism.

**Tunica vaginalis**  
*A note: This term refers to the serous covering of the testis, not directly to penile anatomy, but is included for completeness in urogenital terminology.*

## V
**Veno‑occlusive mechanism**  
The process during erection whereby expansion of the cavernous sinuses compresses the subtunical venules against the tunica albuginea, restricting venous outflow and trapping blood within the penis.
